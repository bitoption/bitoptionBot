This is a very basic initial bitoption bot. So, be nice with comments 
and don't get too angry when you get errors that are our fault :-)

One class of the bot has limited access to the market and should be able 
to write and bid calls and puts.

Another class of the bot is devoted to back testing. This uses 
Black-Scholes to make simple predictions about fair option pricing and 
then uses that to make offers and bids in order to make money.

Instructions:
1)First create a file named "userinfo"
2) Write your username on first line and password on second.
3) Run it as:
    $BitoptionBot.py > output.csv
4) Check out the functions run() and getResults() to see what they take 
    as input and how you can change it!
